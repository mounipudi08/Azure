Cloud Services ---> Gmail /salesforce/netflix
On-premise also known as traditional computing
Cloud Computing 
   -----> Computing services are provided for you 
          Renting computing resources 
          Flexibility and scalability 
          Access to latest technologies 
          Enterprise-level data protection
          Reduced IT staff and admin costs 
If the cloud is set up right , the user won't even know that a failure happened
Technology Pillars of cloud COMPUTING 

VIRTULIZATION ---> not a one-to-one relationship between a physical server and 
a logical server
HYPERVISOR ---> Allows multiple OSs to share the same host ,and manage 
the resources allocation to Virtual OSs

Cloud Service models
Infrastructure as a service ,
Platform as a service,
Software as  a service

Infrastructure as a service --

  Virtual hardware that replaces physical 
  can scale up or down based on needs
  you pay for what you use 
  Internet of things(IOT)
  High performance computing
  Data storage , backup ,and recovery

IaaS -- compute,Block Storage, 
It covers three fundamental aspects
compute --> which is used for providing resources on demand 
block storage ---> which is used for providing blocks that can be used for
 storing information
network --> which are all resources required for providing users networking capabilities

Platform as a service 

This layer add OSs and software
RunTime Environments
allow developers to focous on apps
Provisioning and deployment
Loadbalancing and autoscaling 
APIs,Devops,Integration and ML

Covers three fundamental aspects

object storage --> providing resources on how objects are stored
Identity --> which provides a layer for dealing with user authentication
Runtime --> It also provides a runtime applications to run on 
Queue ---> there's a queue which is based for batch and message processing 
Database --> 


Software as a Service -->
apps are accessed over the internet 
It is the largets of the three models 
Likely the one you most familiar with
Monthly or yearly subscription fee 
Internet connection is required
The biggest concern is a data security

Monitoring,Content,Collaboration,Communication,Finance

Cloud deployment models

These clouds offer the best in scalibility , realiability , flexibility ,
geographical Independence ,and cost effectiveness

public clouds 
   
whatever the client wants , the client gets 
If the client needs more resources ,it simply scales up and uses more
The client pays more , that's part of the deal
operated by the third-party companies

Private Cloud 

---> purchase Virtualization software 
     set up individual clouds 
     within their own network 
     Limited scalability
     Control all its own security


Hybrid Cloud 

   Combines public and private clouds 
   Storage of sensitive info privately
   Tight control of data 
   Enjoy features of public clouds


Characteristics of cloud computing 

Elastic -- grow or shrink as the client's needs change 
Resource pooling -- divided among clients as needed
Rapid elasticity -- fast allocation of resources 
self-service -- automatically access any resources , at any time 
Scalibility -- ability to use more or fewer resources 
broad network access -- resources accessible over the network
pay as you go -- you pay for what you use and when you use it 
Availability -- resources are accessible when a clients needs them

Shared Responsibility Models 
Compute ,storage/database, Networking ,Regions ,Availability zones ,Edge locations

Two or more devices that communicate with each other

Network adapter --> every device today has a built-in adapter
Transmission method --> how data travels from device to device 
Protocol --> Language used for communication 

Protocols 

Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

The protocol of the internet

Process application : Telnet,RDP,SSH,FTP,DHCP,SMTP,HTTP(S)
Host-to-host: TCP and UDP
Internet Protocols: IP,ICMP,ARP,RARP -- IPV6
Network access: Ethernet,Fast,Gigabit,and wi-Fi

Protocols at each layer are responsible for different tasks
Most Protocols are at the process applocation layer

Cloud Access Types 

HTTP(S) -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol(Secure)
RDP -- Remote DeskTop Protocol 
SSH -- Secure Shell 
VPN -- virtual private network 
Direct -- Direct connection to the cloud Provider

HTTPS -- Secure TCP/IP application protocol designed to fetch web pages 
and encrypt data that is transmitted between a web server and its client

client connecting to cloud resources --> most often done through a web browser 
 and the HyperText Transfer Protocol secure 

HTTP is the alternative to HTTPS, and it does not encrypt transmissions
Mostly using web browsers --> Designed to request web pages from web servers
SSL Provider --> Responsible for security of the cloud
(infrastructure & services)

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

Extra Capacity -- almost instantaneously
end-to-end testing -- using different platforms
staging -- different environments

Is a protocol used to log into an online Windows Server instance

RDP from the device that will be logging in to the virtual instance
Windows includes an   RDP client called Remote DEsktop Connection 
There are RDP Clients for other Systems
RDP requires the use of a public/private key pair to authenticate users 

SSH -- Secure Shell 
lets connect to a virtual machine running

VPN -- A VPN is a secure and private network connection that occurs through a public network
PC or laptop -- at home,hotel or another public place

VPN tunnel --> secure internet "tunneled" connection 
Corporate server --> VPN server in the corporate network

Direct Connect Criteria

There is a large amount of data transferred between the cloud and the on-site network

Load Balancing 

Conceived before the cloud 
Act like the web server to the outside world
Load Balancer sends the request to the real servers
Configurations 

Cross-region -- based on IP address routing 
Content-based --- based on type requests


our organization can have performance benefits for high traffic networks and heavily used 
systems.

Benefits 
Performance ,scalibility ,Realibility 


Domain Name System -- The site's name means nothing a device requires an Ip address to connect to site 
THE PORT NUMBER IS COMBINED WITH THE IP ADDRESS

DNS -- 53
HTTP -- 80
HTTPS -- 443
RDP -- 3389
SSH -- 22

Firewall is a hardware and sometimes software solution that serves a network security checkpoint
Firewall filter network traffic based on rules defined by an administrator.

Firewalls

Anti-malware check files for threats
firewalls protect you from network traffic that could be dangerous

How Firewalls Work 

public,private 

firewalls configuration 

default deny , ACL , Inbound/Outbound

Aspects Redundancy Plans 
redundancy referred as fault tolerance
1) HardWare -- storage,processes,memory,or network devices
2)Network -- always available
3)Geographic - several locations will have replicas
4)Process
5)Software
6)Data

High Availability --  service availability is determined in terms of nines
(uptime the provider guarantees)


Disaster Recovery -- Ability to be operational after a  disaster

cloud providers can help with disaster planning
Depending on the SLA, the disaster recovery could fall on the provider

Recovery Objectives

1)Recovery Point Objective
2)Recovery Time Objective


Recovery Point Objective -- max age of files that must be recovered from backups
to restore operations

 servers --> virtualization --> Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing 

Cloud Computing enables companies to consume a compute resource ,
such as a virtual machine , storage , or an application 
as a utility -- just like electricity --rather than having to build 
and maintain computing infrastructures in-house

Highavailability -- usually to protect us against software and hardware failures

Cloud Provider takes care of high availability and disaster recovery(DR)

HA: local failure such as a disk,power supply,etc
DR: natural/human disaster like a fire,flood,earthquake etc

Fault Tolerance:
 very similar to HA but offers zero downtime

Let's create a Windows VM
az group list --output table


Create a resource group if needed
  
az group create \
    --name "psdemo-rg"
    --location "centralus"

Creating a Windows Virtual Machine 
 az vm create \
     --resource-group "psedemo-rg" \

     --image "win2019datacenter" \
     --admin-username "demoadmin" \
     --admin-password "password123"

Open RDP for remote access,it may already be open
az vm open-port \
    --resource-group "psdemo-rg"
    --name "psdemo-win-cli"
    --port "3389"

Get the IP Addresses for Remote Access
